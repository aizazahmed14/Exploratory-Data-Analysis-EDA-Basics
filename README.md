# Data Cleaning and EDA in Python – Jupyter Notebook Tutorial  

Welcome to the repository for **Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python**. This repository contains all the code and data used in the tutorial.  

## 📝 Description  
This project demonstrates how to clean and explore data using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. We work on a sample dataset containing the following columns:  
- **Age**  
- **Gender**  
- **Education Level**  
- **Job Title**  
- **Years of Experience**  
- **Salary**  

### Key Steps Covered:  
1. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Standardizing and normalizing data  
   - Detecting and treating outliers  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Understanding distributions and relationships  
   - Visualizing trends with Matplotlib and Seaborn  
   - Creating interactive dashboards using Plotly
